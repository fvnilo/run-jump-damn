Run, Jump, Damn !
=============

An little platformer game I developped using Pixelman 3 graphic engine (http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2008/04/20/pixelman-3-final/).

You control a little bird that wants to get out of a very long cavern.

### To do's ###
What still needs to be done:
*  Add enemies
*  Add intro/outro (The game will crash at the last level)
*  Add a scoring system
 

### Compile and run ###
To compile the code, you will need
*  [Python 2.7.X (32-bit)](http://python.org/download/)
*  [PyGame 1.9.1](http://pygame.org/download.shtml)


Then you can run the command `python game.py`

### Create executable ###
To create an executable of the game, you will need
*  [py2exe-0.69.win32-py2.7](http://sourceforge.net/projects/py2exe/files/py2exe/0.6.9/)

Then you run the command `python setup.py py2exe`. Your executable will be created in the _dist_ folder. Copy the _player_ and _levels_ folder in _dist_ before running the game
